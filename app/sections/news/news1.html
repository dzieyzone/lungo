       <p>Frankenman International has made a significant new investment; it announced today further investment in Research and Development by the creation of a dedicated R & D Centre in Europe. Federico Bilotti becomes Director of Innovation and Manufacturing (Europe), and will lead the European Idea and Development Center on the prestigious grounds of the Tecno Polo of Castel Romano in Rome. Other large organizations like ISPRA (Italian Institute for the Research in Environmental Protection), CSM (Material Research Center) and smaller start-ups also operate here. The strategy of the European Idea Development Center is to provide support to surgeons that have difficulty currently protecting their ideas with patents and prototyping their inventions, in addition to leading Frankenmans R & D and manufacturing activities in Europe.</p>
