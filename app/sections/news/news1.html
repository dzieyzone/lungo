       <p>Frankenman International has made a significant new investment; it announced today further investment in Research and Development by the creation of a dedicated R & D Centre in Europe. Federico Bilotti becomes Director of Innovation and Manufacturing (Europe), and will lead the European Idea and Development Center on the prestigious grounds of the Tecno Polo of Castel Romano in Rome. Other large organizations like ISPRA (Italian Institute for the Research in Environmental Protection), CSM (Material Research Center) and smaller start-ups also operate here. The strategy of the European Idea Development Center is to provide support to surgeons that have difficulty currently protecting their ideas with patents and prototyping their inventions, in addition to leading Frankenmans R & D and manufacturing activities in Europe.</p>
       <h2>Tecno Polo of Castel Romano in Rome</h2>
       <p>Lee Edwards said, "We are delighted to be able to work with Federico and a larger group of surgeons in Europe and indeed around the world. At a time when some companies are divesting their R & D activities we chose to invest in Europe. Federico's track record in this sector is second to none. He and the team in Europe will provide a valuable support to surgeons and innovators alike and also to Frankenman as we seek to develop new products, support new techniques and develop technologies that provide real benefits for patients and healthcare providers activities in Europe."</p>
       <p>Carlo Caruso, Director of the Tecno Polo Consortium commented favorably to the advent of the European Idea Development Center in an article that appeared on the "Sole 24 ore", Italian daily Finance News, on February 28th. The Tecno Polo Castel Romano provides favorable grounds for the research that Federico Bilotti will be leading for Frankenman; transforming surgeons inventive ideas into devices that improve surgery effectiveness because the choices of materials, rapid prototyping and intellectual property support will be provided by experts on site at the center.</p>
       <p>Federico Bilotti's highly skilled team of engineers adds to the existing 330 material science researchers, 100 energy and environmental researchers and 50 researchers in biotechnology already present in the Tecno Polo Castel Romano.</p>
       <p>This innovative center, at present the only one of its kind, will be an exciting launching pad for new devices in the surgical field.</p>
